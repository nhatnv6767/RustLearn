// fundamentail: Trail
// . A way to specify that some functionality exists
// . Used to standardize functionality across multiple different types
// - Standardization permits functiona to operate on multiple different types
// - Code deduplication
// you would only need to write one function that operates upon a trait, and
// then can call that function with multiple different data types as long as they
// all implement that trait
